Package: blocknetdxd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Blocknet is a 2nd layer blockchain interoperability protocol that enables 
 communication, interaction, and exchange between different blockchains in 
 a permissionless and trustless manner. This implemented through the use of 
 the TCP/IP networking layer for communication, P2P atomic swaps using BIP65 
 for exchange, and a DHT overlay network (Service Nodes) to host the full 
 nodes of compatible blockchains, host microservices, audit interactions, and 
 perform anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. 
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, blocknetdxd, and the CLI tool
 blocknetdx-cli to interact with the daemon.
